		This is the SEconomy transaction journal file.

		You have probably guessed by now this is an XML format, this file persists all the transactions and bankaccounts
		in your server instance.  This file is not written to actively, all transaction processing is done in memory and
		coped out to disk every time the backup runs.

		Editing this file here isn't going to make your changes persist, once edited you will need to execute /bank loadjournal
		in the server console to resync the in-memory journal with this one.  Be aware that you will lose any in-memory changes
		from now until when the file was writte, this usually results in a minor rollback of people's money.

		Obviously it would be retarded to use that command on a journal that is months old.....

	<s>
		BankAccounts Collection

		This element holds all the bank accounts for a running server. Each BankAccount has a unique account number (starting from 1) and more attributes:

		* UserAccountName - The login name of the TShock account this bank account is linked to
		* WorldID - The WorldID that the account was created from, this is used when LockedToWorld is set and you want to lock bank accounts to worlds, otherwise they
		are static and are loaded in whichever world you create on the server.
		* Flags - A bit-bashed set of flags for the account that control the state of it.  Look in the source for BankAccountFlags for a definition of what the bits do.

		Please note, BankAccount elements do not keep a running total of their balance, that is done through summing all Transaction amounts
		(by XPath /Journal/Transactions/Transaction[@BankAccountFK=BankAccountK]/@Amount) linked to this account.
	</s>
	<s>
		Transaction Collection

		This element holds all the transactions for the current running server.  Each transaction is double-entry accounted,
		which means that a transaction is essentially done twice, representing the loss of money on one account, and the gain
		of money in the destination account or vice-versa.

		A double-entry account journal must have two transactions; a source and a destination, and the amounts in each must be
		the inverse of eachother: If money is to be transferred away from a source account the source amount must be negative
		and the destination amount must be positive; and conversely if money is to be transferred into a source account the
		source amount must be postitive and the destination amount must be negative.

		A Transaction has these following attributes:

		* BankAccountTransactionK - A unique number identifying this transaction
		* BankAccountFK - The unique identifier of the BankAccount element this transaction comes from
		* Amount - The amount of money this transaction was for; positive for a gain in money, negative for a loss
		* Flags - A bit-set flag of transaction options (See source for BankAccountTransferOptions for what they do)
		* Flags2 - Unused
		* BankAccountTransactionFK - A unique identifier of the opposite side of this double-entry transaction, therefore binding them together.
